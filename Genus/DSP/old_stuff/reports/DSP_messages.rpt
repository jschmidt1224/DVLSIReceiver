  1   Info  CDFG-250   Processing multi-dimensional arrays.               
  5 Warning CDFG-360   Referenced signal not in sensitivity list.  This   
                       may cause simulation mismatches between the        
                       original and synthesized designs.                  
  1   Info  CDFG-361   Signal is not referenced within the process or     
                       block, but is in the sensitivity list.             
                       Asynchronous logic, such as a latch or             
                       combinational logic, is inferred for this process  
                       or block. Signals that are not referenced can be   
                       removed from the sensitivity list. If the intent   
                       is to infer a flip-flop, ensure that the process   
                       or block is sensitive to the signal edge by        
                       adding 'posedge' or 'negedge' for Verilog designs  
                       or 'event' for VHDL designs.                       
 27   Info  CDFG-372   Bitwidth mismatch in assignment.                   
  1 Warning CDFG-472   Unreachable statements for case item.              
  1 Warning CDFG-480   Ignored redundant case item.                       
                       When multiple case item expressions match the      
                       case condition, only the statements associated     
                       with the first matching item are considered.       
  1   Info  CDFG-500   Unused module input port.                          
                       The value of the input port is not used within     
                       the design.                                        
  1   Info  CDFG-509   Preserving unused register.                        
                       A flip-flop or latch that was inferred for an      
                       unused signal or variable is being preserved.      
                       Better area results are possible if the            
                       'hdl_preserve_unused_registers' attribute is set   
                       to 'false'.

                       Use 'set_attribute hdl_error_on_latch true' to     
                       issue an error when a latch is inferred. Use       
                       'set_attribute hdl_latch_keep_feedback true' to    
                       infer combinational logic rather than a latch      
                       when a variable is explicitly assigned to itself.

                       Optimizations such as constant propagation or      
                       redundancy removal could change the connections    
                       so an instance does not drive any primary outputs  
                       anymore. To see the list of deleted sequential,    
                       set the 'information_level' attribute to 2 or
