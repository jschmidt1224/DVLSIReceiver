  1   Info  GLO-34     Deleting instances not driving any primary         
                       outputs.                                           
                       Optimizations such as constant propagation or      
                       redundancy removal could change the connections    
                       so a hierarchical instance does not drive any      
                       primary outputs anymore. To see the list of        
                       deleted hierarchical instances, set the            
                       'information_level' attribute to 2 or above. If    
                       message is truncated set message attribute         
                       'truncate' to false to see the complete list. To   
                       prevent this optimization, set the                 
                       'delete_unloaded_insts' root/subdesign attribute   
                       to 'false' or 'preserve' instance attribute to     
                       'true'.                                            
 10   Info  LBR-155    Mismatch in unateness between 'timing_sense'       
                       attribute and the function.                        
                       The 'timing_sense' attribute will be respected.    
  1   Info  LBR-161    Setting the maximum print count of this message    
                       to 10 if information_level is less than 9.         
 20   Info  LBR-162    Both 'pos_unate' and 'neg_unate' timing_sense      
                       arcs have been processed.                          
                       Setting the 'timing_sense' to non_unate.           
  1   Info  LBR-41     An output library pin lacks a function attribute.  
                       If the remainder of this library cell's semantic   
                       checks are successful, it will be considered as a  
                       timing-model (because one of its outputs does not  
                       have a valid function.                             
  1   Info  LBR-412    Created nominal operating condition.

                       the nominal PVT values if specified in the         
                       library source, or the default PVT values (1.0,    
                       1.0, 1.0).                                         
  1   Info  LBR-518    Missing a function attribute in the output pin     
                       definition.                                        
 20 Warning LBR-9      Library cell has no output pins defined.           
                       Add the missing output pin(s), then reload the     
                       library. Otherwise, the library cell will be       
                       marked as unusable and as timing model.

  1   Info  POPT-51    Could not declone clock-gating instances.          
                       The design should have 2 or more clock-gating

  1   Info  POPT-92    A potential clock gating enable was not            
                       considered due to the presence of timing
